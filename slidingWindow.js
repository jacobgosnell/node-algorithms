/* Sliding Window

This pattern involves creating a window
which can either be an array or
number from one position to another

Depending on a certain condition, the window
either increases or closes (and a new window
is created) 

Very useful for keeping track of a subset of data
in an arr/string etc.

write a function to find the longest sequence of
unique characters...

"hellothere"

write a function which accepts an array of integers
and a number. The function should calculate the max
sum of n consecutive elements in the array.

maxSubarraySum([1,2,5,2,8,1,5], 2) // 10
