/* Singly Linked List */

/* Linked List - an ordered data structure that stores data
 and contains a head, tail, and length property

Linked Lists consists of nodes, and each node has a value
 and a pointer to another node or null.

In a singly linked list...
Each node is only connected to the next node
In a doubly linked list...
Each node also can go backwards

Comparison with Arrays...
Lists
- do not have indices
- connected via nodes with a next pointer
- random access is not allowed

Arrays
- indexed in order
- inserts and deletions can be expensive from 
 the beginning and middle of the array
- can quickly be accessed at a specific index */
